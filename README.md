# Social Media Profiling System

## Overview
**Social Media Profiling System** is designed to assist recruiters in the hiring process by allowing them to input candidate details, store this information in a secure database, and retrieve candidates' social media profiles through integrated APIs or web scraping techniques. The system aims to streamline the recruitment process by providing a comprehensive view of candidates' online presence.

## Objectives
- Enable applicants to input their details which will be stored in a database.
- Allow recruiters to access and view the database to search for candidates' popular social media platforms.
- Integrate APIs or use web scraping techniques to retrieve and provide links to candidates' social media pages.
- Store retrieved social media links together with the candidates' details in a secure database.
- Create a user-friendly interface for recruiters to input and search candidate details.
- Ensure data privacy and secure storage of candidate information.
- Implement a search algorithm capable of retrieving social media profiles.
- Provide comprehensive documentation, including a user manual and technical specifications.
